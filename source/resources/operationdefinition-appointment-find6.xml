			<h2>Appointment Availability Operation</h2>
			<p>OPERATION: Appointment Availability Operation</p>
			<p>The official URL for this operation definition is: </p>
			<pre>http://fhir.org/guides/argonaut-scheduling/OperationDefinition/appointment-find</pre>
			<div>
				<p>Searches for availability for a future appointment(s) within a time period of defined by date range input parameters.  If neither a start or end date is given then the maximum period as defined by local business rules and starting from when the  operation was transacted will be used.   Other input parameter further refine the search and include  practitioner references, specialties, visit type, locations, and patient information. From these criteria, a system determines which schedulable resources ( e.g., people, rooms, equiibment) are needed for the visit, and provides time slots where all required resources are available.</p>
				<p>Note that for input parameters that are codes, the simple FHIR <a href="http://build.fhir.org/search.html#token">token</a> search parameter type is used instead of the complex <code>Coding</code> datatype.  Also, the simple <code>uri</code> datatype is used instead of the complex <code>Reference</code> datatype for resources references.  This allows either the 'GET'  or the 'POST' syntax to be used to initiate the interaction in many cases.  Examples of both are shown in the below.</p>

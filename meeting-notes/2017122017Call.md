### Agreed to following Phases

1. base patient access
1. base providers access
1. advanced provider/patient/both

comments:

- Need for Patient preferences (advanced) ( i.e. like languages, gender, doctor )
- Scheduling modalities more a background operation that is scheduled behind the scenes

### Resources:

#### R2 <-> R3
*Endpoint (Only in R3):*

- Assume: starting point is known Endpoints

*PractionerRole(Only in R3):*
- Pract:Role 1:*
- V3 allows scheduling the role vs schedule the practitioner

Cerner R2 timing is tough since R3 not targeted until end of 2017.
Consensus of group leaning towards R3

*DECISION to Work in R3 and create an R2 version after publishing if demand and budget is there*

#### Other resources:

Cooper working on OperationDefinitions (instead of using AppointmentResponse) in Forge
